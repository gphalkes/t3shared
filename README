The Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3) is a set of libraries for creating terminal
programs. It was originally created to support the Tilde terminal text editor,
but these libraries can also be used to create other terminal-based programs.
The toolkit consists of the following libraries:

libt3window: provides functions for manipulating the terminal and for creating
  (possibly overlapping) windows on a terminal. libt3window can be used instead
  of (n)curses for drawing on the terminal.
libt3key: provides functions for retrieving the character sequences used by
  terminals to represent keys pressed by the user. The database contains much
  more extensive information than the terminfo database.
libt3unicode: provides functions for using and manipulating UTF-8 encoded text.
  The functions provided can convert UTF-8 into separate codepoints,
  return relevant information about codepoints, and normalize UTF-8 strings.
