This repository contains some code shared by the Tilde Terminal Toolkit (T3)
and scripts to easily work with T3 and tilde as a whole. To check out T3 and
Tilde, first check out the t3shared repository, and then run the init program
to check out all the other repositories. Then, from the directory containing
the t3shared directory, you can run "./t3shared/doall make -C src" to build all
the libraries and Tilde in the correct order.


The Tilde Terminal Toolkit is a set of libraries for creating terminal
programs. It was originally created to support the Tilde terminal text editor,
but these libraries can also be used to create other terminal-based programs.
The toolkit consists of the following libraries:

libt3config:    A library for reading and writing configuration files.
libt3highlight: A library for syntax highlighting different types of text files.
libt3key:       A library and database with escape sequence to key symbol
                mappings.
libt3widget:    A library of widgets and dialogs to facilitate construction of
                easy-to-use terminal-based programs.
libt3window:    A library providing a windowing abstraction on terminals.
